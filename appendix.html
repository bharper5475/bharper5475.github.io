        <dt>ARCTIC FERRETS</dt>
        <dd>Inhabitants of Keeblarium. These small yet agile creatures are adept at weilding magical energy in the form of talismans. Though frail, they have succeded in conqouring all of Keeblarium(Save for the Furmire) due in no small part to thier cunning and avarice.</dd>
    
        <dt><small>[B]</small></dt>
        <dt>BALLROLL, KING</dt>
        <dd>King of the Arctic ferrets. King Ballroll is nearly devine himself, depending on who you ask. Very little is known about his life before he accended the ball, not even his name. it is unknown how he remains alive in his enclosure, for nothing is able to pass through his barrier. He has never been seen eating food of any kind.</dd>

        <dt>CHURCH OF THE WHITE</dt>

        <dt>CRIMBO, KING</dt>
        <dd>The king of the furmire. Very rarely seen by his subjects, and never by outsiders, Crimbo is as paraniod as  he is cunning. after reciving a prophecy that a servent of the FURFATHER would one day strike him down atop his very own pile of grease, he took to a life of seclution and solitude, trusting his for advisors or "Fingers" to carry out his wishes. He bathes twice weekly.</dd>

        <dt>FALLEN</dt>
        <dd>Arctic ferrets not in good standing with the Church of the White. They must consume alcohol to survive after being cut off from the FURFATHER. They may taint talismans to become twisted versions of the FATHERS designs.</dd>
        <dt>FURFATHER</dt>
        <dd>The Diety of the Church of the White. The FURFATHER is said to have bestowed upon king Ballroll the large spherical enclosure that is his namesake, and his mandate with it. All life is said to have been crafted with meticulus care by HIM and HIS craftsmen in Nibblehiem.</dd>
        <dt>FURMIRE</dt>
        <dd>Deep in the souther region of Keeblarium, a vast network of swamps and marshes weaves an intracate web across nearly a quarter of the continent. Vast networks of subterranian tunnel systems allow for quick travel across the whole of the furmire. Controlled by Crimbo, King of the swamp ferrets. Grease.</dd>

        <dt>GREASE RITUAL</dt>
        <dd>A ritual in which a clean adolescent Swamp ferret comes into adult hood. The ferret is dunked into a vat of grease for increasing intervals over the course of three days. When the ritual is complete, the ferret weighs an extra 20 pounds and can glide easily through the watery swamps of the furmire. From this day forward, they do not bathe.</dd>
        <dt>GREY-SKIN</dt>
        <dd>Legendary furless Arctic ferret of Keeblarium myth. Said to have snuck into Nibblehiem to speak with the FURFATHER about the death of his sister. Survived by skinning other ferrets for thier hides.</dd>

        <dt>LURKING FLAME</dt>
        <dd>Precious little is know about what the swamp shamans refer to as "The Lurking Flame". They say that Crimbo touched it once in his youth, and it bequithed upon him the right to rule over the once disorganized tribes of the furmire. It is worshiped as a diety in some parts of the swamp.</dd>

        <dt>SWAMP FERRETS</dt>
        <dd>Residents of  the Furmire, little is known about the origins or day-to-day activites of the Swamp ferrets. Crimbo, thier king, rests atop a mountain of grease in various locations, and is never in one for long. huge subterranian tunnel systems weave thier way across the furmire, and what little has been explored has been deemed uninhabitable by all but the heartiest of creatures.</dd>

        <dt>TALISMANS</dt>
        <dd>Talismans are the principal weaponry used by acolytes of the Church of the White, of which all fighting age arctic ferrets who remain unfallen are a member of. Talismans are strong magical artifacts imbued with the power of the FURFATHER, and may be used in a variety of roles on the battlefeilds of Keeblarium and beyond.</dd>
