            <p class="team-description">Inheritors of the arctic continent of Keeblarium, these cuirous and nimble creatures have quite a few mysteries bundled into thier sordid histories. 
                From the legend of Grey-Skin, the hairless arctic ferret that skinned his own kin to survive the harsh ever-winter of Nibblehiem, to the war-heros of king Ballroll's Army, 
                these creatures have truly cemented themselves in the annals of history as a species not the be trifled with, despite thier less than threatening appearance.

            <p class="team-description">These greasy, hulking masses slither hither and thither, thier nature as mysterious as the murkey water from which they hail.
                 Not much is known of the swamp king Crimbo and his subjects, and what little is is fraught with contradictions and merrymaking.
                 Seldom do Travelers make it back alive from trips through the trecherous gnarles of the furmire, but when they do thier stories all have one commenality; These ferrets STINK!!!
